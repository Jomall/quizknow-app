## Prerequisites
1. A GitHub account (you already have one at https://github.com/Jomall)
2. A Vercel account (you already have one at https://vercel.com/jomalls-projects-f71e4788)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. GitHub Repository Setup
Your code has already been pushed to GitHub:
- Repository: https://github.com/Jomall/quizknow-app

### 2. Deploy to Vercel (Manual Process)

#### Option A: Connect GitHub to Vercel (Recommended)
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import the "quizknow-app" repository from GitHub
4. Configure the project settings:
   - Framework: Next.js
   - Root directory: ./
   - Build command: `next build`
   - Output directory: `.next`
   - Install command: `npm install`
5. Click "Deploy"

#### Option B: Deploy using Vercel CLI (If you have Vercel token)
1. Install Vercel CLI globally:
   ```
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. Log in to Vercel:
   ```
   vercel login
   ```

3. Deploy the project:
   ```
   vercel --prod
   ```

### 3. Post-Deployment Configuration

#### Environment Variables (if needed)
If your application requires environment variables, add them in the Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to your project settings in Vercel
2. Navigate to "Environment Variables"
3. Add any required variables

### 4. Custom Domain (Optional)
1. In your Vercel project, go to Settings > Domains
2. Add your custom domain
3. Follow the DNS configuration instructions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Build errors**: Check the build logs in Vercel dashboard
